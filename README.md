# WebSocketDotNet

A slightly work-in-progress websocket client library for C# which isn't limited to either old or new .NET versions like similar libraries.

Supports .NET Framework 3.5 through (and beyond) .NET 6.

Available on [my nuget repo](https://nuget.samboy.dev/packages/websocketdotnet/) for bleeding-edge stuff - add `https://nuget.samboy.dev/v3/index.json` as a package source.

Also available on nuget [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WebSocketDotNet/)
